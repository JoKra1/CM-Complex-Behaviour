# Otter Gang: An iOS application featuring cognitive agents

### Cognitive Modelling: Complex Behaviour

For the course Cognitive Modelling: Complex Behaviour, we had to create an
ios application that featured cognitive models. We decided to build an app that allows to play the game [Beverbende](https://www.999games.nl/beverbende.html) against three cognitive [ACT-R](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/) models.

### How to play:
First pull this project with XCode, then load the project, and finally press 'run'. The app is designed to work with IPads.
