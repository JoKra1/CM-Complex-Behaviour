## Content
This file contains a summary of the rules for the game Beverbende. The written summary here is based on this [Youtube video by 999 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOepDAjETBA&ab_channel=999Games) (Dutch).

## Begin of the Game
The game can be played with up to six players. Each player receives four cards, which are facing down and placed in front of the player. The player is only allowed to look at the two outer cards once, and thus remains clueless about the values of the two remaining cards in the middle. At the beginning of the game a single card is drawn from the stack of remaining cards and placed face upwards next to the stack of remaining cards, forming the stack of discarded cards.

## Taking turns
During their turn players can pick a card from the stack of remaining cards or the stack of discarded cards. There are regular cards, depicting numbers from zero to nine and action cards. If the card is not a bonus card, the players can decide whether they want to switch one of their own cards with the new card. Otherwise, the card is placed face up on the stack of discarded cards. This marks the end of the players turn.

## Action cards
If the card picked from any of the stacks is a action card, the actions available to the player depend on the face of the card. There are three kind of action cards in the game:

- Peak
- Switch
- Pick again

The peak card allows the player to take a look at any of their own cards. The switch card allows the player to switch one of their own cards with a card of any of the other players, without looking at either ones own or the card of the other player. Finally, the pick again card allows the player to draw a card from the stack of remaining cards and to decide whether or not to keep it. If the player decided not to keep the card they can draw another one and again decide whether to keep it or not. However, they cannot draw a third card in this turn. After the turn the action card is placed on the stack of discarded cards, whether or not it was used.

## Endgame
The player with the lowest number of points, calculated by summing over the numbers on the player's cards, wins the current round. If any player thinks at their current turn that they want the game to end they can decide to 'knock'. Once a player knocked, all other players play one more turn. Then, all players show their cards. If one or more of the player's cards are action cards they are replaced with cards drawn from the stack of remaining cards. If more than one player still has action cards then this is repeated for each of those players, beginning with the player that decided to end the game and then rotating clockwise. Finally, players count their points.

The game ends after four rounds and the player with the lowest number of points over all round wins the game.
